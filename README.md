# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is my first full-fledged project using the python programming language. 
I am most proud of the checking system that I came up with 100% on my own. 
It uses essential nodes 3, 5 and 7 (interchangeable with 1, 5 and 9) in an 
array of index values to find any possible combination for 3 in a row. 
I built the program in sublime text editor, however, I debugged the code 
using Jupyter notebook.
