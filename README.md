# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is my first project using the python programming language. 
- I make use of my new skills with basic data types and functions to bring you a simple and functional 2 player Tic Tac Toe game at the command line. 
- While working through this project, I have learned more about the nature of conditional statements and error handling. 

## HOW TO USE
To use this program, download the python file attatched and run it in the command line python environment.
